# PrepaidEnergyMqttSystem
This Arduino sketch is designed for an ESP8266-based Prepaid Energy System. It reads prepaid "amounts" from an Adafruit MQTT feed, operates a simulated motor (like a power supply), and displays status on an I2C LCD. It also triggers an alert (via a buzzer and Serial output) when energy usage reaches a threshold
